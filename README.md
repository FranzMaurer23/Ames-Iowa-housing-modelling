# Ames-Iowa-housing-modelling
This is project where I preprocess data and then model it with linear, ridge and lasso regression. The goal is to predict house prices.

Data comes from Iowa State. This database contains 1461 records and 80 features, for further details check data description. 

At first I'm doing data preprocessing. Filling nan values and encoding. Then comes backward regression with Akaike criterion. I also do feature selection with VIF. Finally comes 
comparing regression models.
